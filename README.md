# Base and Number system:

What is base?
->simply, Base is a number which represent how many unique representer in this number system. 
there are many types of number system. 
For example I show some popular number system:

              base 10 or decimal :There are 10 unique representer  which 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
              
              base 2  or binary  :There are 2 unique representer which 0 and 1
              
              base 8  or octal   :There are 8 unique representer which 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
              
              base 16 or Hexadecimal:There are 16 unique representer which 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F\n
              
If want to create new number system. Then you can it very easily.
for example I show you :

              base 3 : if I want create 3 base number. then need 3 unique representer. for 3 base number that will be 0, 1, 2
                       And you can any number in the world can represent in 3 base number system. here is a question How?
                       
                       Here, decimal number 100. what is the value in base 3 number system?
